III. Literature Review
Transparent materials play a crucial role in satellite-based internet communication systems, enabling the transmission of data through space. Previous research has explored various aspects of transparent materials and their applications in satellite communication. This literature review summarizes key studies and findings, highlights gaps or limitations in existing research, discusses theoretical frameworks, and establishes connections to the current research.  Summary of Key Studies and Findings:  Transparent materials for satellite communication have been studied extensively. For instance, Zhang et al. (2021) investigated the use of graphene-based materials for satellite communication applications due to their high transparency and excellent electrical properties. The study found that graphene-based materials can significantly improve the efficiency of satellite communication systems. Similarly, Li et al. (2020) explored the potential of using transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) for satellite communication. The authors concluded that TCOs offer high transparency, low cost, and ease of fabrication, making them ideal for satellite communication systems.  Other studies have focused on the use of metamaterials in satellite communication. Metamaterials are engineered materials with unique properties that can manipulate electromagnetic waves. For example, Ramakrishna and Grzegorczyk (2021) reviewed the potential of using metamaterials for satellite communication. The authors concluded that metamaterials offer the potential to significantly improve the performance of satellite communication systems by manipulating the properties of electromagnetic waves.  Gaps or Limitations in Existing Research:  While previous research has explored various aspects of transparent materials for satellite communication, there are still some gaps and limitations. For instance, most studies have focused on the use of single materials, such as graphene or TCOs. However, there is a need for research on the use of composite materials that can offer improved performance and durability.  Additionally, while metamaterials have shown great potential for satellite communication, there are still some challenges that need to be addressed. For example, the fabrication of metamaterials can be complex and expensive, limiting their practical application. Therefore, there is a need for research on the development of cost-effective and scalable fabrication methods for metamaterials.  Theoretical Frameworks or Models:  Various theoretical frameworks and models have been proposed to explain the properties and behavior of transparent materials for satellite communication. For instance, the Drude model is commonly used to describe the electrical properties of metals and semiconductors. The model can be used to predict the optical properties of transparent conductive materials, such as TCOs (Li et al., 2020).  Another theoretical framework is the transmission line model, which is used to describe the behavior of metamaterials. The model can be used to predict the transmission and reflection properties of metamaterials, enabling the design of metamaterial-based satellite communication systems (Ramakrishna and Grzegorczyk, 2021).  Connection to Current Research:  The current research builds on the findings of previous studies by exploring the use of composite materials and cost-effective fabrication methods for metamaterials. For example, a recent study by Wang et al. (2022) investigated the use of graphene-polymer composites for satellite communication applications. The study found that the composites offer improved performance and durability compared to single materials.  Additionally, current research is focusing on the development of cost-effective and scalable fabrication methods for metamaterials. For instance, a study by Zhu et al. (2021) proposed a new fabrication method for metamaterials based on 3D printing. The method offers the potential to significantly reduce the cost and complexity of fabricating metamaterials, enabling their practical application in satellite communication systems.

V. Results
Transparent materials play a crucial role in satellite-based internet communication systems, as they enable the transmission and reception of electromagnetic signals. This section presents the main findings and data analysis of the investigation into the use of transparent materials for satellite-based internet communication systems.  The primary materials considered for this review include glass, polymers, and crystalline materials. Glass has been widely used in the past due to its transparency, mechanical strength, and resistance to environmental factors (Fernandes et al., 2021). However, recent advancements in polymer and crystalline materials have opened up new possibilities for satellite-based internet communication systems.  Polymer materials have gained significant attention due to their lightweight nature, which results in lower launch costs (Zhang et al., 2022). In addition, polymers can be easily molded and shaped, making them suitable for complex optical systems (Kim et al., 2021). According to a study by Zhang et al. (2022), polymer-based materials can achieve transmission efficiencies of up to 90% in the visible and near-infrared regions, which are crucial for satellite-based internet communication systems.  Crystalline materials, on the other hand, offer high transmission efficiencies and excellent mechanical properties, making them suitable for high-performance optical systems (Singh et al., 2021). A study by Singh et al. (2021) found that crystalline materials can achieve transmission efficiencies of up to 98% in the visible and near-infrared regions. Furthermore, crystalline materials have excellent thermal stability, which is essential for satellite-based applications (Fernandes et al., 2021).  Figure 1 below illustrates the transmission efficiencies of glass, polymer, and crystalline materials in the visible and near-infrared regions. As shown in the figure, crystalline materials offer the highest transmission efficiencies, followed by glass and polymer materials.  [Insert Figure 1: Transmission Efficiencies of Glass, Polymer, and Crystalline Materials]  In addition to transmission efficiencies, other factors such as weight, mechanical strength, and thermal stability were considered in the analysis. Table 1 below summarizes the key properties of glass, polymer, and crystalline materials.  [Insert Table 1: Key Properties of Glass, Polymer, and Crystalline Materials]  As shown in Table 1, crystalline materials offer the highest mechanical strength and thermal stability, while polymer materials are the lightest. Glass materials offer a balance between mechanical strength, thermal stability, and transmission efficiency.  The findings of this review highlight the potential of crystalline materials for high-performance satellite-based internet communication systems. However, the lightweight and moldable nature of polymer materials also offers significant advantages, particularly in terms of launch costs and complex optical systems. Glass materials offer a balance between the two, making them suitable for a wide range of applications.  In conclusion, the use of transparent materials in satellite-based internet communication systems is a complex and multifaceted topic, requiring careful consideration of various factors such as transmission efficiency, weight, mechanical strength, and thermal stability. The findings of this review provide valuable insights into the properties and potential applications of glass, polymer, and crystalline materials in this field.
